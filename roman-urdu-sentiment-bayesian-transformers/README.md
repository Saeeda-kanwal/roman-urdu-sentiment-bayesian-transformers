## 🚀 How to Run

### 🔬 1. Train the model (Colab or Jupyter)
Open `01_train_model.ipynb`, run all cells. Modify data or model as needed.

### 🧪 2. Test with inference notebook
Open `02_inference_demo.ipynb`, enter any Roman Urdu sentence and get sentiment predictions.

### 🌐 3. Launch the Streamlit App
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
