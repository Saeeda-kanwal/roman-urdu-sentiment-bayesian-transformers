[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Saeeda-Kanwal/roman-urdu-sentiment-bayesian-transformers/blob/main/notebooks/1_sentiment_training.ipynb)

This project demonstrates **sentiment analysis in Roman Urdu** using BERT and Bayesian Transformers. It is designed to align with the PhD objectives at Idiap Research Institute (ERC BALM Project) with a focus on **interpretability, LLM augmentation, and Bayesian inference**.

## 📌 Features
- BERT embeddings fine-tuned on Roman Urdu sentences
- Bayesian linear layer to capture uncertainty
- HuggingFace tokenizer and transformer models
- Dummy dataset + prebuilt model architecture
- Colab-ready demo notebook

## 📁 Structure
- `data/`: Roman Urdu sentiment data samples
- `src/`: Model, training, and utils
- `notebooks/`: End-to-end training notebook

## 🧠 Technologies
- Python, PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers
- BERT, Bayesian Linear Layer
- Optional: Knowledge Graph embeddings for contextual enrichment
